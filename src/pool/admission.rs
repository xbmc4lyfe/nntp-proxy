//! Backlog-aware checkout admission for article routing.
//!
//! A small backend pool under heavy load can have hundreds of requests queued
//! for a couple of connections. Each of those requests waits its whole checkout
//! limit and then fails, which only adds latency for the client: another
//! backend could have served it, or the client could have retried sooner.
//!
//! Before queueing, a checkout estimates how long it would wait from the
//! pool's queue length and a running average of how long one command holds a
//! connection. When that estimate is clearly longer than the time the request
//! is willing to wait, the checkout is skipped without joining the queue. A
//! skipped backend is unavailable for that request only; it is not an article
//! miss and is not recorded as one.
//!
//! Skipping only helps when another backend can answer. When every backend
//! left in the tier is backlogged, a client request queues on the one expected
//! to free a slot first ([`BacklogLastResort`]) instead of failing outright.
//!
//! Everything on the checkout path is a few relaxed atomic loads; nothing here
//! allocates or takes a lock.
